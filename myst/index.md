##

**QIIME 2™ is a bioinformatics data science platform that is [free for all use](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/LICENSE), [extensible](https://library.qiime2.org), [open source](https://github.com/qiime2), and [community developed](https://github.com/orgs/qiime2/people) and [supported](https://forum.qiime2.org/g/moderators).**

## Actively developed

New tools and features released quarterly.

```

## Validated, reliable, and trusted

Something about doc tests and unit tests and citations (Google Scholar feed?)

## Accessible

QIIME 2 interfaces allow you to work in the environment that you're most productive with. And no need to pick just one: run the computationally expensive steps on the cluster, run the exploratory steps on your laptop, and show off the interactive results on your phone!

## Reproducible

Integrated data provenance tracking ensures bioinformatics reproducibility and even allows you to ["replay"](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/provenance-replay-alpha-release-and-tutorial/23279) your analysis on the same or new data.

No more guesswork on what commands were run!

### Provenance tracking and viewing

Your analysis is complex. QIIME 2 automatically keeps the records you need to ensure reproducibility.

### Provenance replay

Let QIIME 2 write code for you.

#### Replay's auto-generated command line (bash) code.

## Extensible

Anyone can build and distribute a QIIME 2 plugin. Users get access to the latest tools, and developers can rapidly get their methods in the hands of QIIME 2 users.

## Cite QIIME 2

QIIME 2 plugins frequently utilize other software packages that must be cited in addition to QIIME 2 itself.

Lists of citations relevant to your analysis are available through [QIIME 2 View](https://view.qiime2.org). To view the list of citations for your QIIME 2 result, load it at [QIIME 2 View](https://view.qiime2.org) and navigate to the "Details" tab.

Alternatively, command line users can generate lists of citations by running:

```bash
qiime tools citations my-qiime2-result.qzv
```

The [QIIME 2 paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0209-9) should be cited whenever QIIME 2 is used in published research, educational, or other content.
